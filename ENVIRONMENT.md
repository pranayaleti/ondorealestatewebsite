# Environment configuration

Set the public site URL used for canonical URLs and social meta images.

Add the following to your environment (e.g. `.env.local` for local dev, or your hosting provider's env settings):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://ondorealestate.com
```

Notes:
- Use your real production domain.
- Do not include a trailing slash.
- For local development, you can set:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
