We share weekly activity metrics and recommendations."},{q:"How do you screen tenants?",a:"We verify income, credit, criminal background, prior evictions, rental history, and employment.

We then refine neighborhoods, must-haves, and budget before touring homes."},{q:"What down payment do I need?",a:"Conventional loans can start as low as 3% down. FHA often requires 3.5%, VA and USDA can be 0% for eligible buyers. Your lender will confirm options."},{q:"How competitive is the market right now?",a:"Competitiveness varies by city and price band.

We rarely recommend waiving protections; instead we tailor timelines, escalation terms, and credits to strengthen offers."},{q:"What closing costs should I expect?",a:"Plan for 2–3% of purchase price for lender, title, and prepaid items.

Pre-approval and document readiness help keep timelines tight."},{q:"How do you market homes for sale?",a:"For sellers, we use professional photography, video, 3D tours, targeted digital ads, and agent networks to maximize exposure and results."},{q:"What improvements deliver the best ROI before selling?",a:"Light paint, landscaping refresh, lighting updates, deep clean, and minor repairs usually yield strong returns vs. cost and time."},{q:"Can I buy before I sell?",a:"Potentially. We can explore bridge loans, HELOCs, or contract terms that align both transactions with manageable risk."}],g=[{q:"Which loan programs are available in Utah?",a:"Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, jumbo, and specialty options.

We can negotiate seller credits or explore lender options to reduce cash to close."},{q:"What credit score do I need?",a:"Minimums vary by program. Stronger credit typically improves pricing.

Most programs prefer DTI under 45%, though exceptions exist."},{q:"I’m self-employed—what documents are required?",a:"Expect two years of returns, YTD P&L, and bank statements. Some programs allow alternative documentation with conditions."},{q:"Should I buy points or do a buydown?",a:"Discount points can lower rate for the life of the loan; temporary buydowns reduce payments for 1–3 years. We model both scenarios."},{q:"How long is a rate lock?",a:"Common lock periods are 30–60 days. We select a lock that covers your closing timeline with flexibility for extensions if needed."},{q:"When does PMI apply and how can I remove it?",a:"PMI generally applies with <20% down on conventional loans and can be removed as equity grows, per investor guidelines."},{q:"Can I refinance later?",a:"Yes. You can refinance to lower rate, change term, or access equity. We monitor markets and notify you when it’s advantageous."}];function y(e){var n,a,r,y,f,v;let{city:w,service:b}=e,x=(0,i.useMemo)(()=>"property-management"===b?"#1 Choice for ".concat(w.name," Property Management"):"buy-sell"===b?"Buy or Sell Property in ".concat(w.name,", Utah"):"Home Loans and Mortgage Options in ".concat(w.name,", Utah"),[w.name,b]),k=(0,i.useMemo)(()=>"property-management"===b||"buy-sell"===b?"/contact":"/loans/conventional",[b]),q=(0,i.useMemo)(()=>"property-management"===b?"Get a Free Rental Analysis":"buy-sell"===b?"Talk to a Local Agent":"Get Pre-Qualified",[b]),W={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":["Organization","LocalBusiness","RealEstateAgent"],name:l.yy,areaServed:w.name+", UT",url:window.location.href,telephone:l.$n,openingHours:l.Gf,address:{"@type":"PostalAddress",addressLocality:w.name,addressRegion:"UT",addressCountry:"US"},sameAs:l.vB,makesOffer:[{"@type":"Offer",itemOffered:{"@type":"Service",name:"Property Management"}},{"@type":"Offer",itemOffered:{"@type":"Service",name:"Home Buying"}},{"@type":"Offer",itemOffered:{"@type":"Service",name:"Home Selling"}},{"@type":"Offer",itemOffered:{"@type":"Service",name:"Home Loans"}}]},j={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Service",name:"property-management"===b?"Property Management in ".concat(w.name,", UT"):"buy-sell"===b?"Home Buying & Selling in ".concat(w.name,", UT"):"Home Loans & Mortgages in ".concat(w.name,", UT"),serviceType:"property-management"===b?"Property Management":"buy-sell"===b?"Real Estate Agent Services":"Mortgage Lending",areaServed:w.name+", UT",provider:{"@type":"Organization",name:l.yy,url:l.W6}},S=[...("property-management"===b?h:"loans"===b?g:u).map(e=>({q:e.q,a:e.a.replace(/Utah(?!\w)/g,"".concat(w.name,", Utah")).replace(/Wasatch Front/g,"".concat(w.name," area"))})),...(null===(n=p[w.name])||void 0===n?void 0:n.faq)||[]],C={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:S.map(e=>({"@type":"Question",name:e.q,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:e.a}}))};return(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container mx-auto px-4 py-10 space-y-10",children:[(0,t.jsx)(s.default,{id:"city-business-jsonld",type:"application/ld+json",dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:JSON.stringify(W)}}),(0,t.jsx)(s.default,{id:"city-service-jsonld",type:"application/ld+json",dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:JSON.stringify(j)}}),(0,t.jsx)(s.default,{id:"city-faq-jsonld",type:"application/ld+json",dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:JSON.stringify(C)}}),(0,t.jsxs)(c.Zp,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(c.aR,{children:(0,t.jsx)(c.ZB,{className:"text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl",children:x})}),(0,t.jsxs)(c.Wu,{className:"space-y-6",children:[(null===(a=p[w.name])||void 0===a?void 0:a.overview)&&(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:null===(r=p[w.name])||void 0===r?void 0:r.overview}),(0,t.jsxs)("p",{children:["property-management"===b&&(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:["Our full-service property management in ",w.name,", Utah covers marketing, tenant screening, rent collection, maintenance coordination, owner reporting, and legal compliance.
