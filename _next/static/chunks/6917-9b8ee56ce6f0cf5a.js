We share weekly activity metrics and recommendations."},{q:"How do you screen tenants?",a:"We verify income, credit, criminal background, prior evictions, rental history, and employment. Applications are scored against fair, written criteria."},{q:"How is maintenance handled?",a:"Tenants submit requests online 24/7. We triage, dispatch vetted vendors, and keep owners informed. Emergency issues are handled immediately."},{q:"Is there a maintenance reserve or markups?",a:"We maintain a small operating reserve to cover minor repairs and do not add markups to vendor invoices.

We then refine neighborhoods, must-haves, and budget before touring homes."},{q:"What down payment do I need?",a:"Conventional loans can start as low as 3% down. FHA often requires 3.5%, VA and USDA can be 0% for eligible buyers. Your lender will confirm options."},{q:"How competitive is the market right now?",a:"Competitiveness varies by city and price band.

We rarely recommend waiving protections; instead we tailor timelines, escalation terms, and credits to strengthen offers."},{q:"What closing costs should I expect?",a:"Plan for 2–3% of purchase price for lender, title, and prepaid items.

Most programs prefer DTI under 45%, though exceptions exist."},{q:"I’m self-employed—what documents are required?",a:"Expect two years of returns, YTD P&L, and bank statements. Some programs allow alternative documentation with conditions."},{q:"Should I buy points or do a buydown?",a:"Discount points can lower rate for the life of the loan; temporary buydowns reduce payments for 1–3 years. We model both scenarios."},{q:"How long is a rate lock?",a:"Common lock periods are 30–60 days. We select a lock that covers your closing timeline with flexibility for extensions if needed."},{q:"When does PMI apply and how can I remove it?",a:"PMI generally applies with <20% down on conventional loans and can be removed as equity grows, per investor guidelines."},{q:"Can I refinance later?",a:"Yes. You can refinance to lower rate, change term, or access equity.
