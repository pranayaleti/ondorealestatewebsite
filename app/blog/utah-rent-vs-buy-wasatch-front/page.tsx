              The Wasatch Front isn’t one market. Salt Lake urban cores, Silicon Slopes (Lehi/Draper), and Ogden value plays have different rent-to-price ratios, taxes, and maintenance realities. Here’s how I frame the decision for locals.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Inputs (Utah-Specific)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Property tax reset after sale; check county rates by city.</li>
              <li>Snow/ice wear on roofs/pavement; budget maintenance at 1–1.5%/yr.</li>
              <li>Transit + schools drive rent premiums (FrontRunner, I-15 exits, school clusters).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Compare These Ratios</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Rent-to-price</strong>: SLC urban often ~0.4–0.5%; Ogden can be higher.</li>
              <li><strong>Payment-to-income</strong>: keep total housing ≤ 30–35% gross.</li>
              <li><strong>Equity velocity</strong>: amortization + conservative appreciation (3–4%) vs alt return.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Scenario Grid</h2>
            <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
{`SLC urban: higher price, lower rent yield; pay for proximity + transit.
Lehi/Draper: tech wage anchor; appreciation leaning, watch HOA/amenities.
Ogden: value/cashflow; stress-test vacancy and older-building CapEx.
Provo/Orem: student/education anchor; seasonality + parking constraints.`}
            </pre>

            <h2>House Hack Angle</h2>
            <p>Basement ADUs and duplexes along the corridor can tilt math toward owning if you underwrite vacancy and CapEx conservatively.</p>

            <h2>Developer’s Toolkit</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Build a simple simulator: inputs above + rent growth 2–3%, appreciation 3–4%.</li>
              <li>Run sensitivity: +1% rates, +10% expenses, 0–2% appreciation.</li>
              <li>Track by city; don’t apply a single Utah average to all submarkets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>Utah rent vs buy is corridor-specific. Model taxes, transit, school-driven rent spreads, and maintenance. Let the numbers—plus your time horizon—decide.</p>
