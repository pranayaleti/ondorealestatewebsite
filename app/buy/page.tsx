    question: "How do I get started with buying a home in Utah?",

  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve for home buying?",
    answer: "We serve the entire Wasatch Front including Salt Lake City, Lehi, Provo, Orem, Sandy, Draper, American Fork, Pleasant Grove, and surrounding Utah communities.",

  },
  {
    question: "What's the current Utah real estate market like?",
    answer: "The Utah market varies by location, but generally offers good value with strong appreciation potential. Our agents provide current market analysis and pricing guidance for your target areas.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much do your real estate services cost for buyers?",
    answer: "Our buyer representation is typically free to you - the seller pays the commission. We're committed to providing excellent service without additional fees to buyers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with new construction homes?",

  },
  {
    question: "How much should I budget for closing costs?",
    answer: "Plan for roughly 2–3% of the purchase price for lender, title, and prepaid items. We can also negotiate seller credits when appropriate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I compete in multiple-offer situations?",
    answer: "We tailor terms like escalation clauses, appraisal gap strategies, timelines, and earnest money while protecting key contingencies.",
  },
  {
    question: "What inspections are recommended?",
    answer: "General home inspection plus specialty inspections as needed (radon, sewer, roof, structural). We coordinate and advise on findings.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is earnest money and is it refundable?",
    answer: "Earnest money is a good-faith deposit applied at closing. It is typically refundable if you cancel within contractual contingency timelines.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical purchase take?",
    answer: "Most financed purchases close in 30–45 days after acceptance. Cash purchases can close faster depending on title and inspections.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I buy before I sell my current home?",
    answer: "Yes. We explore bridge loans, HELOCs, or contract terms like leasebacks to align both timelines with minimal risk.",
