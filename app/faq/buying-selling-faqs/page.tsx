      question: "Is it better to rent or buy right now in Utah?",
      answer:
        "It depends on how long you plan to stay, how stable your income is, and whether you're comfortable with maintenance and market swings. Our rent‑vs‑own calculators and Utah‑specific blog posts help you see the real, long‑term costs. If you're within a 3–7 year horizon, we'll walk through both paths with actual numbers, not just rules of thumb.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know what my home is worth before I sell?",
      answer:
        "You can start with online estimates, but serious pricing should look at recent local sales, condition, upgrades, and competition. We combine data (comps, days on market) with on‑the‑ground Utah experience to recommend a pricing strategy, then keep adjusting based on showings and feedback.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do before listing my home for sale?",
      answer:
        "Most homes benefit from a deep clean, small cosmetic fixes, decluttering, and addressing obvious repairs. You don't have to fully remodel to get a strong result. We'll walk the home with you and prioritize only the projects that move the needle for your specific price point and neighborhood.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I look for in a rental as a tenant?",
      answer:
        "Beyond price and location, look at responsiveness of management, clarity of the lease, condition of the unit, parking, and how maintenance is handled. With Ondo‑managed rentals, you'll get clear expectations up front, documented move‑in condition, and easy ways to pay rent and submit maintenance requests.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with buying a home in Utah?",
      answer:
        "Start by getting pre-approved for a mortgage, then work with our agents to define your criteria and search areas. We'll help you navigate the entire process from search to closing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do you serve for home buying?",
      answer:
        "We serve the entire Wasatch Front including Salt Lake City, Lehi, Provo, Orem, Sandy, Draper, American Fork, Pleasant Grove, and surrounding Utah communities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you help with first-time home buyers?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! We specialize in guiding first-time buyers through the entire process, including down payment assistance programs, first-time buyer incentives, and educational resources.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the current Utah real estate market like?",
      answer:
        "The Utah market varies by location, but generally offers good value with strong appreciation potential. Our agents provide current market analysis and pricing guidance for your target areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do your real estate services cost for buyers?",
      answer:
        "Our buyer representation is typically free to you - the seller pays the commission. We're committed to providing excellent service without additional fees to buyers.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical purchase take?",
      answer:
        "Most financed purchases close in 30–45 days after acceptance. Cash purchases can close faster depending on title and inspections.",
