      question: "What should I do if my property is damaged in a disaster?",
      answer: "First, ensure your safety and the safety of your family. Then, document all damage with photos and videos. Contact your insurance company immediately to file a claim. Also contact us at " + SITE_PHONE + " so we can help coordinate repairs and discuss payment assistance options."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get help with mortgage payments after a disaster?",

    },
    {
      question: "What is mortgage forbearance?",
      answer: "Forbearance allows you to temporarily pause or reduce your mortgage payments for a specific period (typically 3-12 months) while you recover from a disaster. You'll need to resume payments after the forbearance period ends."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I apply for disaster assistance?",
      answer: "Contact us immediately at " + SITE_PHONE + " to discuss your situation. We'll help you understand your options and guide you through the application process. You may also be eligible for FEMA assistance if your area has been declared a disaster zone."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I can't return to my property due to damage?",
      answer: "If your property is uninhabitable, contact us immediately. We can help arrange temporary housing assistance and work with your insurance company. We may also be able to pause or modify your mortgage payments during this time."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does disaster assistance last?",
      answer: "Disaster assistance duration varies based on your situation. Forbearance typically lasts 3-12 months, but can be extended if needed. We'll work with you to find a solution that fits your recovery timeline."
    },
    {
      question: "What documentation do I need for disaster assistance?",
      answer: "You'll need documentation of the disaster impact, such as photos of damage, insurance claim information, FEMA assistance letters (if applicable), and proof of displacement or income loss. We'll provide a complete list when you contact us."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there government programs that can help?",
      answer: "Yes, FEMA provides disaster assistance for declared disaster areas. The SBA offers low-interest disaster loans. Utah Emergency Management also provides state-level resources. We can help you navigate these programs and coordinate with your mortgage assistance."
