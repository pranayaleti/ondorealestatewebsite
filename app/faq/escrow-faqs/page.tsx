    {
      question: "What is escrow?",
      answer: "Escrow is a neutral third-party process where funds and documents are held securely until all conditions of the real estate transaction are met. It protects both buyers and sellers during the home buying process."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does escrow typically take?",
      answer: "Escrow typically takes 30-45 days, depending on the complexity of the transaction, loan processing time, and any contingencies that need to be resolved."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my earnest money if the deal falls through?",
      answer: "It depends on the reason for cancellation. If you cancel within your contingency periods (inspection, appraisal, loan), you typically get your earnest money back. If you cancel outside these periods, the seller may be entitled to keep it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose my own escrow company?",
      answer: "In Utah, either the buyer or seller can choose the escrow company, but it's typically negotiated during the offer process. Both parties must agree on the choice."
    },
    {
      question: "What are closing costs and who pays them?",
      answer: "Closing costs include various fees like title insurance, escrow fees, loan origination fees, and more. In Utah, these are typically split between buyer and seller, but the exact split is negotiable."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an escrow account for taxes and insurance?",
      answer: "An escrow account is set up by your lender to hold funds for property taxes and homeowners insurance. Each month, a portion of your mortgage payment goes into this account, and the lender pays these bills when they're due."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my escrow account?",
      answer: "You may be able to cancel your escrow account once you have sufficient equity (typically 20% or more) and a good payment history. However, some lenders require escrow accounts for the life of the loan."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my escrow account has a shortage?",
      answer: "If your escrow account has a shortage (usually due to increased taxes or insurance), your lender will typically spread the shortage over the next 12 months by increasing your monthly payment, or you can pay it in a lump sum."
