      question: "What is hardship assistance?",
      answer: "Hardship assistance programs help homeowners who are experiencing financial difficulties make their mortgage payments. Options include forbearance (temporary payment pause), loan modification (permanent payment change), and payment deferral (adding missed payments to the end of your loan)."
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifies as a financial hardship?",
      answer: "Common hardships include job loss or reduced income, medical emergencies, divorce or separation, death of a co-borrower, natural disasters, or other unexpected financial difficulties that affect your ability to make mortgage payments."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I apply for hardship assistance?",
      answer: `Contact us immediately at ${SITE_PHONE} to discuss your situation. Don't wait until you're behind on payments—the sooner you reach out, the more options we have to help. We'll guide you through the application process and help you gather the necessary documentation.`
    },
    {
      question: "What is mortgage forbearance?",
      answer: "Forbearance allows you to temporarily pause or reduce your mortgage payments for a specific period (typically 3-12 months) while you work through your financial hardship. You'll need to resume payments after the forbearance period ends, and we'll work with you on a repayment plan."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a loan modification?",
      answer: "A loan modification permanently changes the terms of your loan to make payments more affordable. This might include lowering your interest rate, extending your loan term, or reducing your principal balance. This is typically for long-term financial hardships."
    },
    {
      question: "Will hardship assistance affect my credit?",
      answer: "If you're approved for a hardship assistance program and make payments as agreed, it typically won't negatively impact your credit. However, if you're already behind on payments before applying, that may have already affected your credit. We'll discuss the specific impact based on your situation."
    },
    {
      question: "What documentation do I need?",
      answer: "You'll need documentation of your hardship, such as pay stubs, unemployment benefits, medical bills, divorce papers, or other proof of financial difficulty. You'll also need recent bank statements, tax returns, and a hardship letter explaining your situation. We'll provide a complete list when you contact us."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the application process take?",
      answer: "The application process typically takes 2-4 weeks once we receive all required documentation. We'll work with you throughout the process and keep you updated on the status of your application."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm denied hardship assistance?",
      answer: "If your application is denied, we'll explain why and discuss alternative options. You may be able to appeal the decision with additional documentation, or we can explore other solutions like refinancing or selling the property."
