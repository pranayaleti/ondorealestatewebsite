      question: "How do I get a payoff quote?",
      answer: `Contact our loan servicing department by phone at ${SITE_PHONE}, email, or through your online account. We'll provide an official payoff statement with the exact amount and validity period.`
    },
    {
      question: "How long is a payoff quote valid?",
      answer: "Payoff quotes are typically valid for 10-15 business days. After this period, you'll need to request a new quote as interest accrues daily."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there prepayment penalties?",
      answer: "This depends on your specific loan terms. Some loans have prepayment penalties, especially in the first few years. We'll include any penalties in your payoff quote."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make a partial payoff?",
      answer: "Yes, you can make extra principal payments at any time. This reduces your total interest and can help pay off your loan faster. There's usually no penalty for making extra payments."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I pay off my loan?",
      answer: "We'll process the payoff, release the lien on your property, and send you a satisfaction of mortgage document. You'll also receive a final statement. The lien release is typically recorded with the county recorder's office."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay off my loan online?",
      answer: "Yes, you can make payments through our online portal. For full payoffs, we recommend contacting us first to ensure you have the correct amount and to coordinate the payoff process."
    },
    {
      question: "What information do I need to request a payoff quote?",
      answer: "You'll need your loan number, property address, and the date you plan to pay off the loan. Having your account information ready will help speed up the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I refinance instead of paying off?",
      answer: "Yes, refinancing is an option that may allow you to get better loan terms, lower your interest rate, or access equity. Contact us to discuss whether refinancing makes sense for your situation."
