      question: "What do I need to bring to a notary appointment?",
      answer:
        "Bring a valid government‑issued photo ID, your unsigned documents, and any required witnesses. For Remote Online Notary (RON), you'll also need a phone or computer with camera, microphone, and stable internet. We'll guide you on exactly what each document type needs before your session.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you notarize documents for out‑of‑state transactions?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Remote Online Notarization lets us notarize for clients located anywhere in the U.S., as long as the receiving party accepts RON documents (most modern lenders and employers do). We regularly support out‑of‑state real estate closings, employment forms, and business agreements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between mobile, in‑office, and online notarization?",
      answer:
        "In‑office means you come to our Lehi office. Mobile means we travel to you in Utah County. Remote Online Notarization (RON) happens completely online via secure video. All three are performed by the same commissioned notary; we'll recommend the best option based on urgency, location, and document type.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get a document notarized?",
      answer:
        "For Remote Online Notary (RON), we can often schedule same-day appointments. In-office appointments are typically available within 24-48 hours. Mobile notary services in Utah County can be arranged with advance notice. Emergency or rush services may be available for an additional fee.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of documents can you notarize?",
      answer:
        "We notarize a wide variety of documents including real estate closing documents, power of attorney, wills and estate documents, business agreements, loan documents, affidavits, and more. If you're unsure if your document can be notarized, contact us and we'll let you know.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does notarization cost?",
      answer:
        "Standard notarization fees vary by service type. Remote Online Notary (RON) typically costs less than mobile services. Contact us for current pricing based on your specific needs. We offer competitive rates and transparent pricing with no hidden fees.",
    },
