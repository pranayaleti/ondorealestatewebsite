    question: "What types of home loans do you offer in Utah?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do I get pre-approved for a mortgage?",
    answer: "Start by completing our online application or contacting our loan officers. We'll review your income, credit, and assets to provide a pre-approval letter that strengthens your buying power.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are current Utah mortgage rates?",
    answer: "Mortgage rates change daily and vary by loan type, credit score, and down payment. Contact our loan officers for current rates and personalized quotes based on your situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the loan process take?",
    answer: "Typically 30-45 days from application to closing, though this can vary based on loan type and complexity. We work efficiently to meet your timeline and closing date.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer first-time home buyer programs?",
    answer: "Yes, we work with various first-time buyer programs including down payment assistance, low down payment options, and special rate programs available in Utah.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refinance my existing Utah mortgage?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We offer rate and term refinancing, cash-out refinancing, and streamline refinancing for FHA and VA loans to help you lower payments or access equity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What down payment do I need?",
    answer: "Conventional loans can start at 3% down, FHA at 3.5%, and VA/USDA may be 0% for eligible borrowers. We’ll confirm your options.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are closing costs calculated?",
    answer: "Expect 2–3% of price for lender/title/prepaids. We can explore seller credits and lender options to reduce cash to close.",
  },
  {
    question: "When does PMI apply and can I remove it?",
    answer: "PMI typically applies to conventional loans with <20% down and can be removed as equity grows per investor rules.",
  },
  {
    question: "I’m self‑employed—what documents are needed?",
    answer: "Usually two years of returns, YTD P&L, and bank statements. Some programs allow alternatives with conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy points or use a temporary buydown?",
    answer: "Points lower the rate for the life of the loan; buydowns reduce payments for 1–3 years. We’ll model both to compare.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does underwriting take?",
    answer: "Underwriting commonly takes 24–72 hours after a complete file. Clear communication and fast document turnarounds keep things moving.",
