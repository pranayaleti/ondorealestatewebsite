const loanFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?",
    answer:
      "A pre-qualification is a quick estimate based on self‑reported info. A true pre‑approval means a loan team has pulled credit, reviewed documents, and issued a letter that sellers can trust. We recommend going straight to pre‑approval before you seriously shop so you know your numbers are solid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I fix my credit before I buy a home?",
    answer:
      "Small improvements to credit can sometimes save you tens of thousands over the life of a loan. Before you wait a full year, have us or your lender model your current score vs. a slightly higher score. In some cases buying now with a refinance later makes more sense than waiting; in other cases, a short credit tune‑up is worth it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What monthly payment should I target?",
    answer:
      "Instead of just shopping by price, we encourage you to shop by comfortable monthly payment. Start from your budget, plug it into our calculators, then walk that back to a price range. This keeps you from getting emotionally attached to homes that would feel too tight month‑to‑month.",
  },
]

const notaryFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What do I need to bring to a notary appointment?",
    answer:
      "Bring a valid government‑issued photo ID, your unsigned documents, and any required witnesses. For Remote Online Notary (RON), you’ll also need a phone or computer with camera, microphone, and stable internet. We’ll guide you on exactly what each document type needs before your session.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you notarize documents for out‑of‑state transactions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Remote Online Notarization lets us notarize for clients located anywhere in the U.S., as long as the receiving party accepts RON documents (most modern lenders and employers do). We regularly support out‑of‑state real estate closings, employment forms, and business agreements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between mobile, in‑office, and online notarization?",
    answer:
      "In‑office means you come to our Lehi office. Mobile means we travel to you in Utah County. Remote Online Notarization (RON) happens completely online via secure video. All three are performed by the same commissioned notary; we’ll recommend the best option based on urgency, location, and document type.",
  },
]

const buySellRentFAQs = [
  {
    question: "Is it better to rent or buy right now in Utah?",
    answer:
      "It depends on how long you plan to stay, how stable your income is, and whether you’re comfortable with maintenance and market swings. Our rent‑vs‑own calculators and Utah‑specific blog posts help you see the real, long‑term costs. If you’re within a 3–7 year horizon, we’ll walk through both paths with actual numbers, not just rules of thumb.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know what my home is worth before I sell?",
    answer:
      "You can start with online estimates, but serious pricing should look at recent local sales, condition, upgrades, and competition. We combine data (comps, days on market) with on‑the‑ground Utah experience to recommend a pricing strategy, then keep adjusting based on showings and feedback.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do before listing my home for sale?",
    answer:
      "Most homes benefit from a deep clean, small cosmetic fixes, decluttering, and addressing obvious repairs. You don’t have to fully remodel to get a strong result. We’ll walk the home with you and prioritize only the projects that move the needle for your specific price point and neighborhood.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I look for in a rental as a tenant?",
    answer:
      "Beyond price and location, look at responsiveness of management, clarity of the lease, condition of the unit, parking, and how maintenance is handled. With Ondo‑managed rentals, you’ll get clear expectations up front, documented move‑in condition, and easy ways to pay rent and submit maintenance requests.",
