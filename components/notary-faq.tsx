        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Yes. Remote online notarizations completed by a commissioned Utah notary are valid
          nationwide because the notarial act is tied to the notary’s location. Always confirm the
          receiving party accepts electronic/remote notarization—we provide the digital certificate,
          audio/video record, and compliance details if they need them.

          Nearly all lenders and title companies accept properly executed RON documents. We follow
          state requirements, use secure identity verification, and supply the audit trail and
          digital certificate so your package clears underwriting.

          electronic signatures and seal, and store the audio/video record. You receive your
