    value: "what-is-fractional",
    question: "What is fractional real estate ownership?",
    answer:
      "Fractional ownership allows multiple investors to collectively purchase a share of a commercial property through a legal entity such as an LLC or SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle). Each investor owns a proportional interest and receives distributions based on their ownership percentage.",
  },
  {
    value: "minimum-investment",
    question: "What is the minimum investment amount?",
    answer:
      "Minimum investments vary by opportunity and typically range from $10,000 to $50,000. Each deal listing specifies its own minimum. This structure lowers the barrier to entry compared to purchasing an entire commercial property.",
  },
  {
    value: "how-returns",
    question: "How are returns generated and distributed?",
    answer:
      "Returns come from two sources: ongoing rental income (distributed monthly or quarterly) and potential appreciation realized at the time of property sale. Distribution schedules and projected return ranges are disclosed in each opportunity's offering materials.",
  },
  {
    value: "legal-structure",
    question: "What is the legal structure of each investment?",
    answer:
      "Each property is held in a dedicated LLC or SPV. Investors receive membership interests in the entity. This structure provides liability protection — your risk is limited to the amount you invest. The operating agreement governs distributions, voting rights, and exit terms.",
  },
  {
    value: "liquidity",
    question: "Can I sell my shares before the hold period ends?",
    answer:
      "Fractional real estate investments are generally illiquid. Most offerings have a defined hold period (typically 3–10 years). Some structures allow secondary transfers with manager approval, but early exit is not guaranteed. Review each offering's liquidity provisions before investing.",
  },
  {
    value: "tax-implications",
    question: "What are the tax implications?",
    answer:
      "Investors typically receive a Schedule K-1 for their share of the entity's income, deductions, and credits. Depreciation pass-through can provide tax-advantaged income. Tax treatment varies based on individual circumstances — consult a qualified tax professional.",
  },
  {
    value: "accreditation",
    question: "Do I need to be an accredited investor?",
    answer:
      "Requirements vary by offering. Some opportunities are structured under Regulation D and require accredited investor status. Others may be available under Regulation A+ or Regulation CF with lower qualification thresholds. Each listing specifies eligibility requirements.",
  },
  {
    value: "risks",
    question: "What are the primary risks?",
    answer:
      "Key risks include loss of principal, illiquidity, tenant vacancy, interest rate changes, market downturns, and property-specific factors. All investments involve risk and projected returns are not guaranteed. Review the risk factors disclosed in each opportunity before investing.",
