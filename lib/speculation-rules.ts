/**
 * Speculation Rules API – prefetch and prerender rules for same-origin navigation.
 * Used in root layout to improve perceived performance (instant navigations).
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Only public, same-origin URLs; no auth/dashboard/owner/tenant (user-specific).
 * - Prerender only for static, side-effect-free pages (no analytics that must fire once).
 * - Eager: above-the-fold / primary CTAs. Moderate: visible/near-viewport links.
 * - Conservative: prefetch on hover or when link becomes visible (footer, secondary).
 * - Document-level rules catch any same-origin <a> href not covered by explicit lists.
