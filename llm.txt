Project: Ondo Real Estate Website (Next.js app router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase).

Preferred style:
- Use modern, accessible, responsive UI patterns.
- Keep answers concise and information-dense; avoid unnecessary explanation.
- When suggesting code, prefer small, focused diffs and reuse existing helpers from `lib/` and `components/` when possible.
- Follow existing patterns for SEO (`lib/seo.ts`, `lib/site.ts`) and analytics (`lib/analytics.ts`, `lib/supabase-analytics.ts`) when touching those areas.

Conventions:
- Framework: Next.js 14+ app router with React Server Components where appropriate.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS plus design tokens from `src/styles/_design-tokens.css` / `design-tokens.json`.
- Components live under `components/` and are generally colocated by domain (search, dashboard, calculators, etc.).
- Use TypeScript strictly; fix type errors instead of using `any`.
- Prefer functional, composable utilities in `lib/` over duplicating logic.

Editing rules:
- Do NOT create extra markdown docs for humans unless explicitly requested.
- Keep new files small and cohesive; avoid large "god" modules.
- When changing behavior, look for existing usage patterns in this repo and match them.
